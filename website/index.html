            <h1>Crunchyroll Unblocker</h1>
            <hr>
            <h2>Download</h2>
            <p>Firefox Users can get the extension <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/crunchy-unblocker/">here</a>.</p>
            <h2>Changelog</h2>
            <h3>3.0.2 - Error handling</h3>
            <p>Up unitl now, every time the proxy server had issues users were presented with never ending loading screens on Crunchyroll. This should be handled better now.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Added a notification that shows up on incorrect proxy settings.</li>
                <li>Added a fallback when the proxy runs into a timeout to not use the proxy.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>3.0.1 - A housekeeping update</h3>
            <p>This release fixes some bugs and removes the code used for "old crunchyroll".</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Removed legacy code</li>
                <li>Do not display password for custom proxy configuration</li>
                <li>Fix checkbox not displaying correct setting for custom proxy configuration</li>
                <li>Use DNS of proxy service</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>3.0.0 - CR-Unblocker turns 3!</h3>
            <p>CR-Unblocker now supports the new Crunchyroll Beta. This means no longer being limited to non logged in usage.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Proxy requests from new token endpoint using a SOCKS proxy.</li>
                <li>Add options to set a custom proxy configuration in extension settings.</li>
                <li>Remove logic handling user logins as we don't need to do that anymore.</li>
                <li>Modernize some code paths for Crunchyroll Classic.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>2.3.1</h3>
            <p>Most issues seem to be errors getting new sessions. I think this is largely related to the reload loop. To improve on this I implemented a timer to only reload once a minute - if the session can not be obtained, it is unlikely to work a few seconds after.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Added timer between session reloads</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>2.3</h3>
            <p>Good news: unblocking while logged in is back!</p>
            <p>Some of you have hinted me a way but I could not replicate it for some reason. Thanks for telling me, and sorry for not getting this working sooner :)</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fixed login handling</li>
                <li>Added disable button to popup to quickly disable the addon</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>2.2.3</h3>
            <p>This is just a small update, sorry still no solution for logged in users :(</p>
            <p>But I removed the unblock servers that do not work anymore, this should make switching faster.</p>
            <p>Also, region switching won't happen while logged in. This way you can login/logout depending on the anime you want to watch. Still inconvenient, but better than nothing!</p>
            <h3>2.2.2b</h3>
            <p>Hi everyone! Maintainer from the Firefox extension here.</p>
            <p>Looks like the original creator (who is hosting the unblock server) of this project has no interest in keeping this up. This is why I'm taking over from here on.</p>
            <p>He said in his "farewell" message to just torrent anime. Please do not do that. Support the anime you love to watch, even more in these challenging times. I'll add some servers to the unblocker pool to "fix" the current problems of session IDs getting issued. Please keep in mind, my resources are limited. If anyone wants to help running unblock servers <a href="https://twitter.com/CrUnblocker">get in touch with me</a>.</p>
            <p>Greetings from Germany. Stay safe and healthy!!!</p>
